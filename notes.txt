- lambda in java: implement a SAM (single abstract method) interface
- Enum is an object that contain only constants
- can use bufferedreader to read stream
- spring is basically a dependency management framework it controls when and how to create object instead of us
	- Spring boot is a simpler/more abstracted version of spring so we can start faster
	- (not too different from Hilt/dagger)automatically set/initialize the dependencies when spring create an
	object
	- autowiring means injecting a dependency inside a bean.. if there are multiple can same class beans can 
	use qualifier annotation
- JPA Hibernate is ORM but unlike propel.. we need to map each class to table manually (along with annotations etc)
	- and they are strict about persistence session. read or update happens on the cache. to upload it to db 
	- need to commit
- for JDBC in spring you can add the dependencies (JDBC and DB driver) in spring initializer)
	in jdbc Spring we can use RowMapper to map a result set to our own objects/class (using jdbc template.query)
- pebble is the simplest (for me) templating engine (along with spring web). pebble is basically twig
