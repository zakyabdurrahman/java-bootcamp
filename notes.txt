- lambda in java: implement a SAM (single abstract method) interface
- Enum is an object that contain only constants
- can use bufferedreader to read stream
- spring is basically a dependency management framework it controls when and how to create object instead of us
	- Spring boot is a simpler/more abstracted version of spring so we can start faster
	- (not too different from Hilt/dagger)automatically set/initialize the dependencies when spring create an
	object
	
	- autowiring means 
- JPA Hibernate is ORM but unlike propel.. we need to map each class to table manually (along with annotations etc)
	- and they are strict about persistence session. read or update happens on the cache. to upload it to db 
	- need to commit
- for JDBC in spring you can add the dependencies (JDBC and DB driver) in spring initializer)
